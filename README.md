# Installation

1. Open the project using Xcode 15 or higher.
2. Install the app on an iPad.

# Screens

## Main Screen

<img align="right" style="width:300px; height:auto;" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a3a266c-18c0-4f81-a8f4-cbf8e9302a3a">

The first screen of the app, here a student can:

- Swap between boards using the `yellow` vowel (nikkud) keys.
- Type using the `white` and `green` letter keys from the selected board, there will be auditory feedback for the user to make sure they typed the letter they wanted.
- Add space (`רווח`).
- Delete the last letter (`מחק תו`) or word (`מחק מילה`).
- Tap the `speaker` icon at the top left corner to hear what was typed into the text line.
- Go to the secondary "settings" screen using the `blue` gears icon.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Grey vowel keys indicate disabled boards. A teacher user can unlock boards for student users.

## Secondary Screen

<img align="right" style="width:300px; height:auto;" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8500cd1-a638-41db-a504-74e287260400">

Also considered the settings screen of the student user, here a user can:

- Go to the main screen using the `blue` arrow icon.
- Swap between `color themes` from the 4 options at the bottom of the screen.

### Log in as another student user:

1. Tap the `dropdown` at the top right corner and select a name.<br>
   No password will be requested on login because no personal data gets saved on users.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature lets multiple students to use the same iPad and still have separate progress tracking for each.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A teacher user can add, edit and remove student users from the users list.

### Enter image mode:

1. Go through the available images per board using the `yellow` vowel keys and the `arrow` keys.
2. Tap an image to select it.
3. The app will redirect to the main screen in image mode.
4. In this mode a student can:
   - Tap the `image icon` to see a larger preview of it, tap on it again to close it.
   - Type the description of what's in the image.
   - Click the `green` checkmark to submit what they wrote.

</p>

The app calculates typos (compared to what's written in the image's description) and adds the student's progress to their statistics.

> [!Tip]
> To exit image mode without altering the statistics make sure the text line is empty.

> [!Note]
> The app has a built in database of images with set descriptions, but a teacher user can add additional images with custom descriptions.

### Login as teacher to gain access to the teacher settings screens:

1. Tap the login button at the left top corner (`כניסת מורה`).
2. Input the default teacher password `teacher123`.
3. Tap the login button again.
4. The app will then redirect to the teacher screen.

> [!Note]
> The app doesn't store any personal information, so the teacher login needing a password is only to ensure that student users can't get into them on accident and "get lost" in the app.

# Usage

1. If more than one student uses the app on this iPad make sure the student selects their name in the secondary screen.
2. Teach the student as you would using the LIAM method, ask them about the sounds, let them type, and use the "image mode" when working with images.
3. Unlock more boards in the teacher screen as the student progresses and check their progress in the statistics page.
4. Add new student users and new images as necessary.

> [!TIP]
> If during teaching you'd like to be able to type a letter without it making a sound you can mute the iPad output.

> [!NOTE]
> The app is fully local, it uses no external storage and doesn't need an internet connection.
